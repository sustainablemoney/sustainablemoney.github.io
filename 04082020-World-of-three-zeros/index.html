      <h4>A look at Social Businesses</h4>
      <h5>A review of <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33785340-a-world-of-three-zeros'>A World of Three Zeros</a> by Muhammad Yunus</h5>
      <p class="date">April 8, 2020</p>
        <p>
          Honestly, this book was difficult to read without being so distracted by how arrogant the author is. This is not to say Mr. Yunus's micro-financing scheme developed in the 1970s in Bangladesh isn't worthy of praise or even worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize he won in 2006, but instead to say the book is riddled with self-promotion, arrogant assumptions that he introduced the concept of sustainable businesses, and several board strokes statements about how things work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that my critique of the quality of the writing has been made clear, let's get into the content a little. The gist of the book is that global economic inequality to rampant, and in order to create a more equitable society, we need to create businesses Yunus labels <b>"Social Businesses"</b><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> which are defined as a financially self-sustaining business that does not generate profit or dividends for its investors and is designed to address a social problem<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. Yunus means the business model as an alternative to traditional capitalism which according to him is denoted by the selfishness of the owners and investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three zeros that the widespread creation of social businesses are meant to be:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>zero poverty</li>
          <li>zero unemployment</li>
          <li>zero net carbon emissions</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Although an entire chapter is dedicated to each the zero net carbon initiative and the zero unemployment initiative they both take a back seat to the zero poverty initiative. It's more as if these two secondary initiatives are denoted as ways to reduce poverty, and acknowledging that specifically in the case of climate change and the author's home country of Bangladesh, the poor are significantly more impacted by despite their relatively low contribution to the problem<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <h5>Take aways I felt were valuable:</h5>
        <p>
          Before going on a long rant than you may not read about all of the problems that I found with the book, I do want to highlight a few things that I thought were valuable insights.
        </p>
        <h6>Corruption in Government as a Limiting Factor of Equality</h6>
        <p>
          The author highlights that corruption in government &mdash; and also in corporations, though this is less discussed &mdash; is a problem in all systems, but especially in governments whose constituents have been long plagued with poverty. The author discusses his own Bangladesh, but also with more broad strokes that a government that has unequal concern for different citizens will put money and resources toward some, but not all, leaving others in a state of being able to help themselves into a better situation. These resources might be money spent on physical infrastructure like roads and power lines, or they might be human resources like doctors and educators.
        </p>
        <h6>The extremely poor do not have the resources to get themselves out of poverty</h6>
        <p>
          Although I'm as much a 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps' kinda gal as the next one, there is no question in my mind that people who have been systematically excluded from advancement are in a position where grit and determination are not always the only way to get out of it. The author calls the extremely impoverished "Bonsai People", people that at the starts of their lives have the same potential as anyone else, but have been only given enough resources to survive and never thrive to their fullest potential. This I believe is an elequent and visual way of describing the situation that 1 in 10 people on earth face<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <h6>Young people are frustrated with the status quo</h6>
        <p>
          This is not a novel point, however Millennials and Gen Zs are in fact quite frustrated, and are in fact starting and working for businesses that are mission driven<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. Although the author may make the attribution to himself that more businesses are being started with those who are struggling in mind, I think there are many things that can be attributed to the trend. The first of which is the access younger people have to see and hear what problems impoverished individuals face, the second is the financial hardships that particularly Millennials faced upon entering the job market, and the third being the very real problems already being faced due to climate change and the apparent ambivalence of many of those in power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that young people are frustrated, and the fact that Millennials, who were born between 1980 and 1995 (give or take based on the source, I'm not too worried about which source says which dates, it's all about the same), are adults and growing in influence in the economy, I think it's very reasonable for the author to think of them (us) as a potential force for change. However, naming the groups that are meant to teach social business to you people "Yunus & Youth" is just another example of the author's self-promotion<sub><a href="#6">6</a></sub>.
        </p>
        <h5>Issues I had with this book:</h5>
        <p>
          I had many problems with this text. As I mentioned before I felt like the author was self promoting and pompous. He attributed far too much to himself, insisting time and time again that never before did people think about the fact that impoverished people have the potential to be valuable to the market if given the opportunity to get themselves out of poverty, nor that people had ever before stood up to an oppressive upper class to demand equality. He also claims that the idea of the unemployed starting their own businesses originated not only as a result of his actions, but also very recently<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. Also that it should be surprising to learn that a nation (Uganda) that is a country which has lacks an efficient market place for goods and services is a nation of entrepreneurs, and that it doesn't make complete logical sense that the West has a lower ratio of entrepreneurs because many markets work at scale, thereby employing more people.
        </p>
        <h6>You can either be a Job Seeker or Job Creator</h6>
        <p>
          The problems listed above are ones of perception, there are a couple things the author promotes that I believe are fundamentally wrong or misleading. The first is that "we should tell our daughters and sons they can be job seekers or job creators, and that they should prepare to make this choice"<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>. Although I respect that the author comes from a region of the world that has less economic freedom than the United States, and also acknowledge that it is important to teach young people (and not so young people for that matter) that they can be entrepreneurial and don't have to stick to the status quo of a 9-5 working for someone else, I think the sentiment puts people too much in an either or mindset. People's careers are fluid, there are times during one's career where the best think you can do is work for someone else, even if it means your time is spent earning someone else money, and other times where having the ingenuity to be a self-starter is more valuable. To say outright that young people have a choice to make is to imply they don't have a choice to make after they've taken the opportunity to learn and grow in an environment where they are not in charge or on the hook for ever dollar earned or lost.
        </p>
        <h6>Social Business entrepreneurship is only accessible by those already financially solvent</h6>
        <p>
          Another issue is actually with the principal of the social businesses themselves. A typical format for the businesses is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="quotation">
          Someone or someones (either people or large multinational corporation) takes it upon themselves to create a business model that employs people who are impoverished &mdash; and maybe are traditionally blocked from normal employment like illiterate women in third world countries or former convicts &mdash; to sell a good that the company creates. Often times this good is something valuable to improve the lives of the people they are selling to (nutritionally enriched yogurt, or cell phones for instance), and sometimes the goods are locally sourced. The sales folk and the sourcer of goods are eligible to financially gain from the endeavors, the investors and owners are not.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is interspersed with the author's making bold claims about everyone becoming an entrepreneur, when really this is the opposite. Despite the fact that the author I know is intending on raising up the poor and giving them the freedom to lift themselves out of extreme poverty it creates a sentiment of us and them. It means that in this system that he is promoting, only when an individual is free from the shackles of poverty can they transcend into social business entrepreneurship. The people that are employed by the social businesses are just that, employed. They may need to be <i>entrepreneurial</i> and self-starters, they may even be paid on commission based on their sales, but they are not themselves entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
        <p>
          You may guess that I do not recommend the book. I do however think that the framework &mdash; although somewhat inflexible &mdash; for thinking about businesses when they are being created is a useful one to consider. I am very much of the opinion that you don't need to be a bleeding heart to do good in the world, and the concept of social businesses which I view as basically being a self-sustaining non-profit falls in line with that belief. I however do think that a business can be in the traditional sense for profit, but developed with values that lift up those who are often under-served.

        <li id="2"><sup>2</sup> Although Muhammad Yunus may be the person who named the concept and who set a set of guidelines for a financially sustainable business designed to do social good, the idea of people deciding to start businesses that are designed more to benefit those who need help than to financially benefit themselves is not new. If a telephone company enlisting women to sell telephones and communication services counts as a social business, so do companies like Avon which empower women to make a living for themselves selling skin care products. The restriction saying the owners of the business should not benefit financially from the success of the company perhaps prevents companies like Avon or Stella & Dot from being considered, but the idea is not unique.</li>
        <li id="3"><sup>3</sup> The Bangladeshis have much to worry about with <a href="https://ejfoundation.org/reports/climate-displacement-in-bangladesh">sea level rise</a>. As one of the most dense and one of the poorest nations in the world, it really is imperative to the people's livelihoods that climate change is addressed.</li>

        <li id="7"><sup>7</sup> "It is interesting to note that my idea of turning unemployed people into entrepreneurs originated in a country that was almost exclusively a country of petty farmers until forty years ago. Now I am urging the highly industrialized West to adopt this idea to solve the problem of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. If this happens it will be a reversal of the usual pattern whereby new ideas get invested in the West and then gradually find their way to the Global South" <i>Page 107</i></li>
