      <h1>Dogmas of the FIRE Movement</h1>
      <h4>And how financial independence may be disrupted if we all do what we're supposed to do</h4>
      <p class="date">April 23, 2020</p>
        <p>
          On my front page, I ask "How can the dogmas of minimalism and financial independence be used together to inform a path towards environmental sustainability?" An astute reader (my brother-in-law) asked what I meant by that, so I feel like now is a good opportunity to dive into that a bit as well as discuss some of my concerns about it, after all this isn't just a sustainability blog, it's a sustainable <i>money</i> blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those of you unfamiliar, the FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) movement is a growing trend among younger than traditional retirement age people to save a significant portion of their income, invest, and set themselves up to be able to retire<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> significantly early.
        </p>
        <h5>Here are the basics:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Save more than you spend to having 25x your annual spendings saved
          </li>
          <li>
            Invest those savings and earn passive income.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you retire spend less than 4% of your portfolio annually<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> (if you're invested in the stocks and bonds primarily).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That's really it. Of course it's easier to save 50% or more of your income if you earn more, the most frequent criticisms of the FIRE movement is it a game for 6 figure earners, and frankly it's a fair critique. One combatant to the argument is to suggest that lower earners make strides to earn more as a method to "grow the gap"<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>, and not accepting that they can't earn more.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, I think the philosophies are great, and ascribe to many of them myself. People consciously rejecting consumerism in order to lead a more fulfilling life (in the long run), creating long term goals for themselves that create for them the freedom from financial stress is in so many ways good and healthy. People who take ownership over their finances are the ones that were actually able to reap the benefits of the economy that up until the COVID crash has been booming for the last 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what if everyone were to develop a lifestyle of less spending and less consumerism while also investing significant portions of our capital into the wider market? The thesis of <a href="03102020-functional-inefficiency/">Functional Inefficiency</a> was that we <i>could</i> have an ever increasing economy without destroying the environment if and only if we maintained a high level of consumerism - just consuming services instead of goods. Given that one of the primary ways in which people attain their FIRE status is by investing in the market, on the guiding principle that the market over an extended period of time always grows. Now, people who are truly dedicated to the idea of retiring early and living off passive income from their assets may decide to invest in other assets like real estate, but it remains something that only a portion of the total population can participate in before the concept unravels.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we've learned anything from the last month during the COVID-19 shutdowns, it's that we don't need quite as many new things, that it's personal connections that bring us joy, and also that when people aren't buying as much (or working as much), the economy suffers<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. There have been a lot of articles in the news recently saying that the bear market will be the downfall of the FIRE Movement<sup><a href="#5">5</a> <a href="#6">6</a></sup>, while others speculate it will just weed out people who aren't fully committed to making it work, but indeed this is what they had planned for all along<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. I personally don't think that a recession is going to be the end of the FIRE movement, but it does put us in a scenario that simulates a shirking economy with less consumerism throughout all of society.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing that is talked very widely of in Vicki Robbin's book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78428.Your_Money_or_Your_Life">Your Money or Your Life</a> which inspired many FIRE seekers is developing our social capital<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>, and how having close relationships with people can reduce our need to spend money on goods and services that might otherwise be something you can borrow from friends. Of course physically relying on friendship right now is not something we are able to do, but I have found that as a result of being physically isolated from our friends and family nearby, we've all made more effort to verbally check in with people, regardless of their physical location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people who seek financial independence are not planning on retiring early (or at least not truly retire decades early), but instead move into a more entrepreneurial role, creating value for other people in one way or another. True, in some cases someone can claim financial independence because their blog about how to be like them<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> earns ad revenue, but in a lot of cases it's creating something from their passions, or using their financial freedom to think about big problems (or small problems) in the world and help to fix them without worrying about whether it will bring in significant additional income. In a world where the economy is not continuously expending, where consumerism is down, that financial freedom to start something new without worrying about profitability may be reduced, but the drive to be self-sufficient outside of finances may increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, the dogmas of Financial Independence and the FIRE movement are overall quite positive. Save money, stop selling your time, work for yourself, and create meaningful relationships with people, but it nevertheless depends on a continuously expanding economy. In the future I'd like to dive more into what an environmentally sustainable and socially responsible financial independence looks like, but for now I'll keep learning.

        <p id="subtext">Although a panoramic of Joshua Tree National Park may not seem relevant, the wide desert view instills a sense of freedom, but with its limitations. In order to survive, just as in early retirement, you must be thoughtful with your resources. If you start running low on water, you need to either find more water or leave the desert. If you're assets have lost too much value, you may need to cancel - or postpone - early retirement.</p>

      <h5>Footnotes</h5>
      <ul class="footnotes">
        <li id="1"><sup>1</sup> In many cases "retire" is a lose term, mostly used to indicate leaving a 9-5 for the purpose to working on something that maybe doesn't provide much income but does fulfillment. Really it's about getting financial independence so you can do what you want. For more information, <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache</a> is a popular place to start.</li>
        <li id="2"><sup>2</sup> Note, this is 4% of the value of your portfolio at any given time. If your portfolio drops, you're annual withdrawal drops. Some people take a more conservative approach of only 3% a year. <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-4percent-rule-in-retirement-2388273">Learn more about the 4% rule</a></li>
        <li id="3"><sup>3</sup> <a href="https://affordanything.com/financial-independence/">Growing the Gap</a> according to Paula Pant.
          <ul>
            <li>Side note, I'm a big fan of Paula's podcast Afford Anything. I initially listened to her stuff for real estate specific content, but now simply for financial insight.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="4"><sup>4</sup> Despite stimulus packages that mask the damage of the slumped economy as a factor of the S&P indexes, it's probable that COVID-19 is going to have some <a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2020/03/the-effect-of-covid-19-on-the-u-s-economy/">long term effects on the US economy</a> as 70% of the US GDP comes from consumer items.</li>

        <li id="8"><sup>8</sup> Social capital is a measure of the strength of one's relationships and how much we can rely on each other for our needs (tangible and intangible). I don't recall if Vicki Robin refers to it exactly as "social capital", but it is also brought up in Functional Inefficiency by that name.</li>
        <li id="9"><sup>9</sup> Travel blogs especially suffer from this, but a few are actually worth their salt, for instance <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-i-became-nomadic-matt/">Nomadic Matt</a>. </li>
