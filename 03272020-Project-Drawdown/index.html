      <h5>A list of things that might just work</h5>
      <p class="date">March 27, 2020</p>
      <p>
        <u>The Drawdown</u> edited by Paul Hawkin (along with the help and authorship of several other people) is basically a list of 100 things that we can be doing to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, 80 of those are things where they have been studied and implemented at enough of a scale that they were able to do analysis and estimates as to a) how much carbon emission is avoided and b) how much money it's going to cost initially to implement and how much money it'll save us in the long run.

        <img src="../images/page_240.jpg"/>
        <p id="subtext">I'm also not fully convinced the book was set up well for kindle, I was on page 240 for a really really long time</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Don't be fooled into thinking the book is filled with proposals for the individual to do &ndash; don't worry guys, I knew this going in &ndash; but it is instead very much focused on updates to the systems infrastructural systems in place. There is a section at the <i>end</i> of the book that discusses this (though the section is called "An Opening", so perhaps it is not meant to be at the end). There are a few things mentioned which are dependent on consumer choices, but overall most solutions are up to the producer to fulfill.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solutions outlined in the book cover a wide variety of opportunities, some of which are well known and predictable (increased solar and wind power usage, eating a plant rich diet, improved electric vehicle), whereas other solutions are less in the vernacular of the everyman climate solution. I'm going to talk a bit about some of those because I felt they were inherently more interesting as someone who has been relatively paying attention to what's going on in climate policy, but had not heard much about them.
      </p>
      <h5>Some interesting solutions:</h5>
      <h6>Removing HFCs from refrigerants</h6>
      <p>
        This was ranked as <i>the number one</i> way to reduce carbon in the atmosphere in the book<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Some context, in the late 1980s and early 1990s the Montreal Protocol was adopted which required the removal of CHCs and HCHCs from refrigerants because of their impact on the ozone layer (i.e. creating a hole in it). CHCs and HCHCs were replaced with Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) which we later discovered are significantly harmful as greenhouse gas emitters, especially at the end of their usefulness. In 2017 The Kigali Deal was drawn up to amend the Montreal Protocol and add HFCs to banned substances. Of course, the US has not ratified the Kigali deal, though 15 individual states have<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. Although I had known previously about the move to stop using CHCs, I had never thought much about the specific chemicals used as refrigerants and their individual impact being so great.<sup><a href="3">3</a></sup>
      </p>
      <div class="blog-image three columns u-pull-right">
        <img src="../images/kernza_root.jpg"/>
        <p id="subtext">The root structure of <a href="https://landinstitute.org/scientific-pub/wild-plants-rescue/">Perennials (right) vs. Annuals (left)</a>. As you can see, the perennial grains have a much deeper root structure which provides a lot of benefits to the soil and the land it grows on.</p>
      </div>
      <h6>Silvopasture and no-till farming</h6>
      <p>
        Silvopasture is the use of semi-wooded areas as pasture land. This is brought up several times in several different ways as separate solutions (silvopasture, aspects of indigenous peoples land management, afforestation<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>). The idea here is that the nutrients that the animal being cultivated (mostly cows) get more nutrients from semi-wooded lands, the trees provide erosion control and exist as a carbon sink as well as draw nutrients up through the soil. It also allows multiple sources of revenue from an acre of land (pasture land, as well as potentially an orchard of sorts).
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept behind most of the land use and agricultural related solutions is less about what goes into the soil and more about not disrupting the soil. The authors cite several times the concept of untilled land being more drought resistant, erosion resistant, and requiring little to no additional fertilizer<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. Planting and growing perennials instead of annuals also was suggested as a way to decrease carbon in the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        But how does adding trees, using perennials, and not tilling your land result in reduced atmospheric carbon? Ultimately, what it comes down to is the root structure being deeper, more elaborate, and more carbon rich, while allowing farmers to continue to use and reuse the same land year after year without degraded soil quality. Agriculture as it has been done in the 20th century in particular has resulted in smaller root beds, thinner topsoil, and significant erosion. By allowing the roots to stay in the ground there is not only carbon sequestered by the plants and stored in the form of the plant itself, but the soil itself also becomes more carbon rich and a microbiome is fostered which can improve overall harvest yield.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the things that I think is appropriately acknowledged in the book is that the various forms of silvopasture and agro-forestry are farmer lead. In a section entitled "The Man Who Stopped the Desert" by Mark Hertsgaard<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>, about a farmer by the name of Yacouba Sawadogo in Burkina Faso, Africa who started a movement of agro-forestry, we get the quote "Agro-forestry's success does not depend on large donations from foreign governments or humanitarian groups - donations that often do not materialized or can be withdrawn when money gets tight". This concept is acknowledged in a few places throughout the book with regards to solutions that are noted as having the potential to be particularly impactful.

      <h5>Reading this book in the time of COVID-19 shutdowns</h5>
      <p>
        I started reading this book sometime after borrowing it on March 10th, and finished it yesterday March 26th, during which time a lot has happened, most notably the Shelter in Place orders that are happening around the nation<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>. While I'm not going to get into the impact that the pandemic is having on the healthcare system or the economy or the mental health of the billions of individuals told to self-isolate, in the context of climate solutions mentioned in <u>The Drawdown</u>, a few stand out.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Tele-presence</b>: Basically working remotely. We're getting a taste of what working from home en masse looks like, and also ironing out the kinks of how to do it effectively. The book mostly refers to the emission reduction that results from fewer business trips, but I think that the last few weeks have revealed the very real ability to remove driving to work from our daily lives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Airplanes</b>: The book mostly talks about the ways in which engineers are working toward making airplanes and air travel more fuel efficient, but the thing that stood out to me was the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> which intends to use the emissions from 2020 as the benchmark above which emissions must be offset. I will be curious to see what amendments will be made to that intended benchmark given that nearly all airlines have reduced the number of flights they are performing, especially long haul and international<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>, which is what CORSIA focuses on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        People trying to have an optimistic take on what's going on in the world right now have noted the decrease in atmospheric pollutants all over the world<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>, but of course this is a result of reduced production and economic activity which simultaneously has caused the end to the 11 year bull market. There is no reason to think that once restrictions are lifted and the virus has completed its run that we won't go back to similarly carbon inefficient lifestyles, it does however show us what's possible, and how quickly and efficiently nature cleans itself up.
      </p>
      <h5>Final Thoughts:</h5>
      <p>
        <u>The Drawdown</u> was a comprehensive look at literally 100 potential solutions to climate change, and the impact that each of them can have. I think the authors did a good job of making sure to make each solution stand alone - though the number of times they said methane equates to 34 times the greenhouse warming impact as CO<sub>2</sub> got a bit redundant. Published in 2017, several of the solutions that were mentioned as "Coming Attractions" have gained and lost traction<sup><a href="#11">11</a> <a href="#12">12</a> <a href="#13">13</a></sup>. The authors I believe are optimistic, but it is great to see that <a href="https://drawdown.org/">Project Drawdown</a> is very much still actively updated as more research and results come in.

          <sup>4</sup> The authors make a point of saying that they do not double count any of the carbon withdrawn from the atmosphere in any of their solutions, however especially in the case of silvopasture, it feels like the estimates of breadth are overly optimistic, with inherently some double counting.
