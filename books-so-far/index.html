          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
          <p class="recommendation">It is exactly what it says it it, a very short introduction to the economic concepts. Though I don't know if I specifically recommend this intro over other intros, I do recommend reading some intro for economic context.</p>

          <p class="recommendation">An interesting journalistic read about the winners and losers of climate change. The author provides a reasonably balance perspective and some valuable insights into the experiences of others.</p>

          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
          <p class="recommendation">Specifically very interesting to me at the time of reading while trying to figure out what actually can be done to impact our emissions, but repeats itself a lot (100 different sections, each section meant to be read by itself)</p>

          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐</p>
          <p class="recommendation">A fun informal read, but has the same problem as Project Drawdown with repetitiveness without the same degree of scientific rigor.</p>

          <p class="title">The Inner Level</p>
          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐</p>
          <p class="recommendation">The book seems to lean heavily on the success of the authors previous book The Spirit Level, and provides a heavily biased argument about what makes income inequality so bad. Although I agree that income inequality is indeed not good for a healthy and happy society, there are several leaps made that offer a bit to be desired (it seems like a bit of a leap to say that cleaning one's house before visitors arrive is an indicator of how income inequality makes us want to hide who we really are). That being said, it was an engaging, albeit at times choppy, read that highlighted correlations (though it neglects to provide degrees of correlations) between income inequality and other problems found in modern society.</p>

          <p class="title">The Passion Economy</p>
          <p class="rating">⭐⭐</p>
          <p class="recommendation">
            This is a book about bosses. It starts out well in identifying and describing the way that businesses can and need to rethink they're product in order to remain successful in an increasingly globalized world (hint: take your self out of the competition and do something you're uniquely qualified to do). After a strong start, it dives into several individual stories about people who run businesses - many of whom inherited their business from a parent and managed to make it work, and then finishes off oddly with a dive into a technology used by a fast food company to manufacture empathy in the workplace using AI. Even forgiving the unexpected flow of the book, it does well to undermine the value of people who "do the boring work" that keeps the ship afloat, which is to say it felt like if you're not in a situation to be able to create some passion based business for yourself, your work is not viewed as important. The book is not without merit, but overall feel a little flat.

          <p class="title">The Big Short</p>
          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
          <p class="recommendation">
            Michael Lewis is a talented author who is skilled at finding and describing interesting people in interesting situations, and the 2008 financial crisis was certainly an interesting situation. While I feel like he missed an opportunity or two to describe a few interesting women who were in the room at the time - women where mentioned in the book lack personalities and exist mostly as wives and sometimes as nameless voices on the other end of the phone until they are given names nearly 200 pages into the book and then promptly forgotten on the very next page. Despite this, I enjoyed reading the book not just as a narrative and a history, but as a way to better understand what had actually happened to the housing and bond market leading up to the Great Recession. I appreciate the effort that Lewis made both in the concluding chapters of the book as well as the epilogue to emphasize that this is not a happy story. The people that got rich from betting against the housing market aren't extremely happy about it, and the people that screwed over millions of Americans mostly came out of it all filthy rich anyway.

          <p class="title">The Value Investors: Lessons from the World's Top Fund Managers</p>
          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
          <p class="recommendation">
            Ronald Kahn's "The Value Investors" might not be 5 stars for everyone, but for me it really hit the spot. It's an interview book, but unlike The Passion Economy another recent interview book that garnered only two stars, Kahn does not attempt to disguise what he is writing about as something more than speaking to interesting people (who also happen to be very successful value investors) about their backgrounds. Based on a glance at some other reviews of the book, several of the value investors in the book are very well known and perhaps someone who is actually in finance would find it silly and "heavy on the philosophy, light on the strategy", however as someone not in the industry, I found the look into the investor's upbringings and philosophies to be rather enlightening. Kahn does also state very clearly early on that the book is not for those looking for value investing strategy.

          <p class="title">The 4 Hour Work Week</p>
          <p class="rating">⭐</p>
          <p class="recommendation">
            I was unable to finish this book before being so utterly annoyed with the author's arrogance. If you're willing to manipulate your friends and coworkers, force everyone around you to work around your schedule that only benefits you, and succeed only through semantics, then this book is for you. The one good point that I found useful was that often times people see a problem and make a feeble attempt at solving it before allowing it to persist, while it's often useful to not allow the status quo to define the future.

          <p class="title">Essentialism</p>
          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
          <p class="recommendation">
            <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism">Essentialism</a>, by Greg McKeown addresses several of the same issues as the 4 Hour Work Week, but in a way that allows you to respect the people around you. As many lifestyle design books do, it does occasionally get a little woo woo, and the line "Non-Essentialists do this, but <i>Essentialists</i> do that" was uttered a few too many times. Regardless, the book provides a nice framework for rethinking how to organize your time and priorities so you can not only be more productive but also more balanced and lead a sustainable (in the work life balance sense) life.

          <p class="title">Who Gets What -- and Why</p>
          <p class="rating">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
          <p class="recommendation">
            Alvin E. Roth's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22749723-who-gets-what-and-why">Who Gets What</a> was a fascinating read that dives into the economic theory of matching two or more things. Coming from a non-economic background I found the book both accessible as well as detailed in it's explanations of the difficulties that arise from poor market design when both parties care who the other is (from school admissions to kidney transplants). Reading the title of the book (at least without the subtitle <u>The New Economics of Matchmaking and Market Design</u>) one might have suspected that the book would have more of a social-economic nature discussing the advantages of wealth, but don't be fooled, it's actually just a really good primer for game theory and market design.
