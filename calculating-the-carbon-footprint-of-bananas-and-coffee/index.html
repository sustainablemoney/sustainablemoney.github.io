      <h4>How bad is my coffee?</h4>
      <h5>Plus a brief review of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7230015-how-bad-are-bananas">How Bad are Bananas?</a> by Mike Berners-Lee</h5>
      <p class="date">April 15, 2020</p>
        <p>
          Reading <u>How Bad are Bananas?</u> was enjoyable, quick and a good reference when thinking about the choices I make and how they impact my overall carbon footprint. The author does a combination of looking at very specific figures gotten from highly tuned sources to making rough estimations based on things that we don't really know how exactly to calculate. It is worth noting the book came out 10 years ago next month, so when he talks about changing light bulbs, we already did that! There are other places where we have made big strides in sustainability in the last 10 years that are worth mentioning, like the portion of renewable resources that are used for electricity and the proliferation of e-readers.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing that Berners-Lee is a little inconsistent with (although in many places he admits it) is when he does and does not include the complete cost of production of an item, and when he is considering the impact of the profit made <i>by the seller</i> as an impact. His main point is the order of magnitude of the carbon impact a single event or item consumed will have rather than exact number of grams of carbon-dioxide equivalent<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> (hereafter CO<sub>2</sub> e) that are consumed. A cup of coffee for instance, is an order of magnitude less expensive than a paperback book, and an order of magnitude greater than an email with an image or two attached.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could go on about the things I thought were done well verse what I felt could do better, but I'm instead going to change things up. Rather than continuing to dive into a full on book review, I want to, using the calculations that Berners-Lee has provided as well as some additional resources I've scoured off the internet, take a closer look at the impact of a 12oz cup of coffee.
        </p>
        <h5>Carbon Cost of Coffee</h5>
        <p>
          Berners-Lee says the carbon cost of a cup of coffee is 23g CO<sub>2</sub>e if you only boil what you need, so a percolator, 55g is you boil only what you need and add milk, and 74g if you boil double what you need and add milk. Also 343g for a large latte... but we're going to focus on straight coffee. Though he doesn't say what size the coffee is, given that the difference between the latter two figures is 19g CO<sub>2</sub>e, and that should only cover the additional water boiled. Given that he's assuming an electric kettle and he's discovered that it's 70g to heat a quart (or liter) of water in a kettle, then we can determine that the size of the cup of coffee is 8.7oz. Given that this is America, and we drink larger cups of coffee here (the author is english) I'm going to upgrade that to 12oz, therefore the cost of heating the water is 26g CO<sub>2</sub>e in the kettle, and 18.75<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> in the percolator which is a stovetop item (50g CO<sub>2</sub>e on the stovetop).
        </p>
        <p>
          What all of this means is that based on this assumption, Berners-Lee is only attributing 4g per cup of coffee to all of the other resources that go into drinking it including the production, the shipping, the roasting, the distribution of the coffee grounds, as well as the long term upkeep (or not) of whatever vessel you're using, and potentially the methane releases of the coffee grounds after their disposal - though it's possible he didn't include that is his calculations. Let's see if that adds up.

        <h6>Methane Release from Decomposition</h6>
        <p>
          According to <a href="https://watchmywaste.com.au/food-waste-greenhouse-gas-calculator/">Watch My Waster</a> which also describes the CO<sub>2</sub>e ratio for methane to be 25x, 1kg of food waste creates 1.9kg CO<sub>2</sub>e. I just measured the weight of the coffee grounds that I normally consume, and it's about 15g per brewed cup. Given that, the methane release of the grounds alone is 28.5g CO<sub>2</sub>e if not properly disposed of. What's interesting however is that ground coffee that <i>has</i> been composted instead of put directly into a landfill has the potential to absorb up to 7% of it's weight (about 1g) in methane gas<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>, which brings us to an equivalent of -25g CO<sub>2</sub>e. If you're composting in your backyard like I am, then there is only the embedded cost of the tumbler to consider when calculating the cost of composting (as opposed to the required transport and upkeep of an industrial composting facility).
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on variations between the potential release and potential capture of methane gas per cup of coffee and them not being articulated in Berners-Lee's description of the carbon cost, I think it's safe to assume they were not included.
        </p>
        <h6>Drinking Vessels</h6>
        <p>
          There are two main options when it comes to coffee drinking vessels - reusable mugs and disposable cups. We could go into the difference between a ceramic mug and a steel travel mug, but we're not going to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Calculating the carbon cost of a disposable cup seems pretty straight forward, because most of the cost is tied up in the production and waste, but it also depends on whether the paper is sustainable sourced or if it is the result of deforestation.  Unrecycled, the cost of the cup is 8.1g CO<sub>2</sub>e, but recycled it is only 3.8g CO<sub>2</sub>e<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. Let's assume you're going to recycle if only because you're reading this.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it's the result of deforestation, and a cup weighs 10g, that's 7<sub>E-6</sub>% of a deforested hectacre (500T CO<sub>2</sub>e) or 35g of CO<sub>2</sub>e consumed<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. Your standard Starbucks paper cup is made of 10% recycled materials<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>, and you can probably assume that the paper they are sourcing is coming from land that is designated for paper production, and after it's been used it will be used again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reusable coffee mugs are slightly harder to calculate with accuracy, because you have to consider the production cost of the mug as well as the cost of washing the mug. Let's say you have 10 mugs (they accumulate okay!), you use one a day and the average lifespan of your mugs is 10 years. That means on average you're using each mug 36 times a year and 360 times during it's lifetime<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. According to one study, you have to use a single mug 350 times to make it more carbon efficient than a paper cup that has been recycled<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> due to having to wash it. So if the carbon cost of a mug after 350 uses is 3.8g x 350 or 1.33kg CO<sub>2</sub>e, and you use it 360 times, the cost is about 3.7g CO<sub>2</sub>e per use. The one benefit is that once in a landfill a ceramic mug will have virtually no methane gas release, and also takes up significantly less space, so if the paper coffee cup <i>would</i> have been thrown away, the number of times a mug needs to be reused drops significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems prudent to mention the carbon efficiency of making a new percolator (about 500g of steel). Steel production creates carbon emissions about about a 1:1.85 rate of weight of steel to weight of CO<sub>2</sub>e. So if you use your percolator once a day for 10 years, that's 925g CO<sub>2</sub> / 3650 uses, or only about .25g per use, relatively negligible.

          <p id="subtext">A detailed breakdown of the supply chain of coffee based on the study noted <a href="#9">here</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <h6>Coffee Production</h6>
        <p>
          Based on the research I found, I can't believe that Berners-Lee considered the carbon cost of coffee production in his estimate. According to a study done by the Business Association of Latin American Studies, the carbon cost of a cup of Costa Rican coffee shipped to Europe is 59.12g CO<sub>2</sub>e<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> including consumption. In the study it notes that about 71% (42g CO<sub>2</sub>e) of the carbon cost is in the consumer making it, and as Berners-Lee suggested, much of that comes from heating up water. 24% (14g) is made up of the roasting, packaging and distributing, while 5% (3g) comes from the disposal of coffee<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're getting your coffee from a coffee establishment, then you may also want to consider the infrastructure cost of that coffee existing. 8% of the 16.5 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions per year come from the store itself<sup><a href="#11"></a></sup>. Starbucks makes 60% of it's profit from beverages<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> - for the sake of argument let's say that all their beverages are coffee. They serve 15.6 million cups of coffee a day, so 5.7 billion cups a year. That's in theory 138g CO<sub>2</sub>e baked into your to-go cup of coffee just by getting it from starbucks. Now, one might note that the ovens that are being used to make their baked goods don't contribute to the cost of your cup of coffee, ovens only make up 9% of their carbon emissions in store.
        </p>
        <h6>Conclusions</h6>
        <p>
          I think it's safe to say the production costs of coffee are not considered by the author of <u>How Bad Are Bananas?</u>, nor are the methane costs of grounds making their way into a landfill. Given this information, I think some new values are in order, and can be checked out in the <a href="#results">table</a> above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given that I drank 12oz of coffee with about a tablespoon of milk in it, and will be backyard composting my grounds, when asked how bad is my coffee, I can answer it's producing 100.7g CO<sub>2</sub> worth of waste.

      <ul class="footnotes">
        <li id="1"><sup>1</sup> The standard way of referring to the degree of greenhouse gas emissions is to refer to them in terms of their carbon dioxide equivalence. For instance 1g of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted is also 1g of CO<sub>2</sub>e, whereas methane which is more potent as a greenhouse gas is more like 25g CO<sub>2</sub>e (or according to <a href="https://drawdown.org/">Project Drawdown</a>, which honestly you should probably refer to because it's more recent and more researched 34g CO<sub>2</sub>e).</li>
        <li id="2"><sup>2</sup> Now that I do those numbers, it's possible that he was drinking a 12oz cup of coffee all along, and boiling the kettle on the stove. The reason I had initially believed that it was an electric kettle is my British boyfriend has assured me it would be very un-British of him to <i>not</i> have an electric kettle. Regardless it does not actually change my calculations for how much the carbon cost of my cup of coffee is.</li>
