      <h4>A review of Peter S. Wenz’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Functional_Inefficiency.html?id=zbVvDwAAQBAJ">Functional Inefficiency</a></h4>
      <p class="date">March 10, 2020</p>
      <p>
        How do we reduce unemployment, increase human wellbeing, and increase the size of the economy while also staying within the confines of the American political and social environment as well as what constitutes a sustainable level of environmental resource consumption? Wenz’s Functional Inefficiency explores different strategies that have been used in the past and potential strategies that could be used in the future to achieve these goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book is dense with information, reasonably well back arguments (30% of the total thickness of the book is dedicated to notes and index), and challenges our assumptions about the relationship between economic efficiency and human happiness. Not having an economics background, I had to renew the library book twice in order to get through it all &ndash; also much of the time I spent reading it was on the bus, so typically of fairly short durations &ndash; but definitely worth the read.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wenz bases much of his arguments on the idea that a continuously growing economy is the ultimate goal, stating that periods of economic growth strongly correlate with periods of increased social equality. I think it should be noted however that income inequality has been increasing over the last several decades, despite economic growth, which (given the sentiment that if “I’m doing well, I’m more likely to be alright with someone else doing well”) may attribute to the current political environment in the United States right now<sup><a href="#1" class="footerlink">1</a></sup>. Ultimately the goal of every chapter of the book was to explore strategies to reduce unemployment.</p>
      <p>
        Efficiency is evaluated in many ways throughout the book, but the two ways Wenz comes back to time and time again is whether something is functionally efficient, and whether it is fundamentally efficient. Admittedly, ‘functional’ and ‘fundamental’ look similar enough I had to double check every time he mentioned one of them that I had read the right one. What is fun{ction/dament}al efficiency though?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Functional efficiency describes your classic dollars output over dollars input model &ndash; or some cases over time
        </li>
        <li>
          Fundamental efficiency describes the resulting human wellbeing in a more subjective way.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p id="subtext">Strategies for reduced unemployment and their fundamental and functional efficiencies</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        We are challenged then to consider for each strategy the following four questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Does it reduce unemployment?
        </li>
        <li>
          Does it embody efficiency or inefficiency?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is it environmentally sustainable?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is it culturally and politically acceptable today in America?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There were several interesting points that were made throughout the book, and we explored different strategies to idle workers, and strategies to create new jobs, some of which are fundamentally inefficient (idling through a growing prison system), others functionally inefficient (idling through increased vacation and decreased hours), and both (American healthcare as it stands today). I’d like to take a moment to dive into a few things that stood out to me and my specific interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, Wenz describes the environmental impacts of the foundation of the american economy. He not only touches on the fact that we already use too much water and emit carbon an unsustainable rate, but also that as the economies of other nations, namely India and China continue to grow, and the middle class grows, there has been and will continue to be an increased demand for ‘an American middle class level of quality of life’ and therefore an American middle class carbon footprint. As a result of the increased demand for things like air conditioners, personal vehicles, commercial flights and beef, the demand on environmental resources has the ability to increase tenfold. This point in and of itself is the fundamental argument that if we are going to have continued global economic growth, we need to decrease the environmental resource consumption by those with a high standard of living.

        I’m already a big proponent of public transportation, and use it where I can. 4.5 years in the Bay Area made public transportation easy, having moved down to SoCal recently life is a little tougher, but regardless I still have found the bus system usable, even if not great. Wenz talks about the impacts of a poor and inefficient transportation system. One of those impacts, just so happens to be jobs. In 2008 and 2009 when the US government bailed out the auto industry, the motivation was jobs, and not just the jobs of those working directly for the companies that were bailed out, but also jobs of those who benefit indirectly from the industries staying afloat<sup><a href="#2" class="footerlink">2</a></sup>. However an efficient public transportation system would more efficiently create jobs than continued development in the auto industry. One thing that I had never really thought about is the cost of “free” parking, and how it impacts the viability of public transportation. Though I’ve often associated areas that have inordinate amounts of parking (and yet also hardly a place to park) with areas that had poor public transportation, or where public transportation was only used by those who could not afford a personal vehicle, it had not occurred to me that in and of itself having significant parking on or just off the road makes an area less dense thereby reducing the efficiency of public transportation. This section of the book gave me better context and vocabulary to be able to argue for the benefits of a quality public transportation system.

        Finally, Wenz closes the last few chapters on consumerism. In general it seems that consumerism is fundamentally inefficient, at least as it stands today in that it reduces social capital and increases our need to be competitive with one another. Unfortunately Wenz concludes that while consumerism isn’t great for our wellbeing, it is so embedded in American culture and economy that in order to have a continuously growing economy we have to maintain our consumerist ideals. Simply, he states, that we should shift our focus from goods to services that can expand exponentially without an increased impact on the environment. This was a disappointing end to what I found to be an enlightening and enjoyable read.<sup><a href="#3" class="footerlink">3</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall I found Functional Inefficiency to be engaging, practical, and informative. Critics of the book might argue that an infinitely expanding economy should not be the ultimate goal, and that advocating (along with an improved health care system, public transportation system, and education system) that we expand the economy through paying for and providing services like rent-a-grandma and baby-namologists is ludicrous. It does however raise the question of if people plan to retire especially if they plan to retire early (see FIRE movement), while they themselves might not partake in spending money on things they can do themselves, how else are their investments in index funds meant to support them for decades to come? But more on that later.
