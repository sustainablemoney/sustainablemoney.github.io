      <h2>
        A Look into ESG funds, their investments, and whether they are achieving the goals that you
        want them to.
      </h2>
      <p class="date">October 5, 2020</p>
        <p>
          According in MorningStar, as of the end of June, sustainable investment funds, or ESG funds
          were managing 250 billion dollars in assetssup<sup><a href="#1" class="footerlink">1</a></sup>.
          ESG stands for <b>Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance</b> tends to be the type of
          fund people refer to when they are talking about sustainable investments. Often times these
          are "Exclusionary" funds, which seek to remove investment assets which score poorly in
          the ESG ratings
        </p>
        <h4>How are Stocks rated for ESG?</h4>
        <p>
          One of the "big" ratings agencies for the ESG worthiness of a stock or a fund is <a href="https://www.msci.com/esg-ratings">MSCI</a>,
          which from their website "strive[s] to bring greater transparency to financial markets, enabling the investment community to make better decisions for a better world." They might not be the only reliable source for quality ESG
          ratings, but in my research they came up time and time again. Their tool allows you to search
          for an individual stock and see where they are leaders in an area normally deemed important
          to sustainable investing, and where they lag behind their industry competitors, as well as
          view their rating which follows a similar order as other ratings companies use for bonds
          (AAA is the best followed by AA, all the way down to CCC)<sup><a href="#2" class="footerlink">2</a></sup>.
          This works very well for investigating individual stocks, but is a little less clear cut
          when you start looking into mutual funds and ETFs.
        </p>

          <p id="subtext">
            Until ESG funds started doing well during the pandemic and they switched to charts
            showing upward trends, the imagery around ESG funds is always very green and emoting a
            sense of sustainability in the most traditional sense. Source:
            <a href="https://culturetalk.com/2019/09/trends-that-are-transforming-business-esg-investing-purpose-and-culture/">CultureTalk</a>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Before we look into exactly what you'll find in an ESG fund, I want you to consider what you
          or a typical investor who is drawn to sustainable investing might want to be investing in
          and what their goals are. Of course their goal is to make money, it is an investment after all,
          but probably also to invest in things that are more good than evil, to put their money
          where their mouth is when they say that want to stop climate change and social injustice. They
          certainly are advertised as such by many popular media sources<sup><a href="#3" class="footerlink">3</a></sup>.
          One might want to offload the work of finding which renewable resource companies are
          actually making things work, and which have weak business models. Perhaps, and these are the
          people who will be least surprised by the assets found in traditional ESG funds, they want a
          fund that looks a lot like other Growth Stock funds, but with a few things removed.
        </p>
        <h4>Contents of a typical ESG Fund</h4>
        <p>
          If you look at the contents of many of the larger ESG funds, you'll find they look quite similar
          not just to each other, but to what any other etf might look like. In the table below I compare
          the top 10 holdings of three major ESG funds and for good measure, the Vanguard Growth fund which
          is not a sustainability based fund.

        <p class="note">* Not an ESG fund</p>
        <p>
          Are there any you are surprised to find? I was surprised that every single one of the etfs
          have significant assets in Amazon, Apple <i>and</i> Facebook (Microsoft and Google I
          &mdash; perhaps unjustly &mdash; tend to consider less evil). To argue that "ESG" funds are
          beating the market is simply to say that if you heavily invest in major tech firms that
          were somehow deemed sustainable, socially good, with transparent and just corporate governance,
          despite their sketchy records, then you'll beat the market when tech giants are bullish.
        </p>
        <p class="quotation">
          "Even where an ESG index did beat the market, it had little to do with environmental, social or governance issues. Instead, it came down to luck: did they happen to pick the stocks that best rode out coronavirus lockdowns? It is better to be lucky than right; but having, as some did, less exposure to cruise liners or long-haul airlines because of their carbon footprint was luck, not a well-thought-out way to avoid the stocks hurt most by Covid-19. There are several reasons why Microsoft tends to score well on ESG, but its cloud services being in demand because everyone is working from home isn’t among them."<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          It should also be noted that for nearly exactly the same fund, Vanguard's expense ration on
          their ESG fund is 0.12%, where as for their Growth fund it is 0.04%. Of course neither of
          those are extremely high because in general Vanguard is known for their low fees, but it still
          a 200% difference.
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusions</h4>
        <p>
          When I first had been hearing that more and more people were investing in ESG funds while
          simultaneously these funds were beginning to beat the market, I became skeptical. What I discovered,
          that they tend to be heavily invested in FAA(N)G stocks, just like everyone else, was different
          that my first suspicion. What I'd first suspected was that as a result of an influx of cash
          into the stocks that were deemed sustainable, their prices were being artificially inflated due to
          demand and excitement<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. As it is, this suspicion has been proven false.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the investor's goal in choosing an ESG fund is to mirror an normal growth or index fund but
          to not invest in a few specific companies are are dumping oil in the sea, or have major corporate
          governance scandals actively being investigated, then ESG funds make a lot of sense. If however
          an investor's goal is to put money into causes they believe in, further research is definitely
          in order.

          a BBB or average rating when Disney is a "Laggard" in two areas, while Netflix is "Laggard"
