          In 2017 the Guardian published an article citing <a href="https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240">this</a> Carbon Majors Report which determines that 71% of global carbon emissions can be contributed to just 100 companies<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Why am I talking about this now, nearly 3 years later? I bring it up now people people are still citing the study, often times as a way to make you angry with big corporations and to relieve the oneself of feeling the pressure to clean up their carbon habit, but the facts are destructively misleading.
        </p>
        <p>If you take the time to read the report (it's not long), it states that it's made an attempt at contributing carbon emissions to something other than the countries the consume the energy that creates the emissions, and instead to the source, the companies that provided us the energy in the first place. From the report, this is how they describe the carbon attribution:</p>
        <div class="quotation">
          <p>
            Direct operational emissions (Scope 1) and emissions from the use of sold products (Scope 3: Category 11) are attributed to the extraction and production of oil, gas, and coal. Scope 1 emissions arise from the self-consumption of fuel, flaring, and venting or fugitive releases of methane.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scope 3 emissions account for 90% of total company emissions and result from the downstream combustion of coal, oil, and gas for energy purposes. A small fraction of fossil fuel production is used in non-energy applications which sequester carbon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emissions of this scale have traditionally been collected and accounted from the national-level by organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA). This is the first and only database containing global-scale emissions, past and present, at the company-level
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In other words, 10% of that 71% (or about 7%) is actually emitted by the companies that are listed, where as the remaining 65% are emitted as a result of the fossil fuels that they sell to consumers - in some cases that's individual consumers like you and me, in other cases that's corporate or state consumers, but either way it's not ExonnMobile who is emitting nearly 2% of global carbon emissions by themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this is not meant to give those companies a free pass for the 2/3 of total global emissions that they did not themselves emit. If it were a case of companies just trying to be companies and meeting the needs of consumers within the confines of what is legal to do and say we are not holding corporations up to go out of their way to do what it better for mankind even when it is against their own interests (which is not to say we shouldn't), then the <i>blame</i> for those 23,429 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> should be directly on the consumer and the manufacturers of consumer items that then consume fossil fuels. This could only be the case if those companies were not also investing millions of dollars every year into lobbying and political campaigns<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>, which is of course not the case.
        </p>
        <h4>Why does it matter that the figure is misleading?</h4>
        <p>
          When you first heard the figure that 71% of carbon emissions were caused by 100 multi-billion dollar companies, how did you feel? Did you feel surprised and saddened, thinking that all that work you've been putting in to reduce your own carbon footprint is for naught? Did you feel angry that we're told to take responsibility for our environmental impact when 100 companies are responsible for over two thirds of emissions? Did you have that jaded post-2016-election, post-occupy-movement, post-Great-Recession thought that went "Of course. Of course major corporations are responsible for global climate change and not the little guy. But the little guy suffers anyway"? Did you feel relieved that you don't have to worry about making choices for the planet? But did you look at the list? Did you realize that all of those corporations were fossil fuel companies? Did you question it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Effectively, by spreading around the statistic without realizing that your own carbon emissions from driving your car, or running your heater, or flying to Europe are likely included in that 71%, you are absolving yourself of your personal responsibility for your own actions and your carbon habit. Even if individually your eating less meat or taking the bus is going to have a minuscule direct impact on emissions, every time you do or don't spend a dollar on something you are supporting system that represents the values that you are living by, in other words, you're voting with your wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are so many ways that data can be misleading<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. Sometimes the raw data we receive from a study can be technically correct, but the way that something was studied was faulty &mdash; this is common in surveys where questions may lead a participant to a certain answer, but can be an issue in other studies &mdash; in which case the results are not reliably interpretable. Other times there are so many nuances to the way data is being described that without paying close attention it can be easy to miss the truth. In a world where information can be passed around the globe in seconds and anyone with the Internet has an opinion it becomes especially important to be critical of statistics that are shared with us, even (or especially) by people or groups with whom we tend to agree. Even after assessing that information is correct and checks out, it's still important to recognize why it's been shared with you and what the informer's intention was. Unfortunately, this is exhausting, and we can easily fall into the trap of letting other people do the due diligence of vetting data before sharing, and the cycle continues.
        </p>
        <h6>In conclusion....</h6>
        <p>
          Should we hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their role in global climate change and environmental destruction? Absolutely. Should we hold corporations that make products for consumers responsible for their role in consuming fossil fuels and emitting green house gases? Absolutely. Should we hold ourselves accountable for the role we play in consuming directly and indirectly fossil fuels and other greenhouse gas emitting activities and products? Yes. Absolutely, yes.
