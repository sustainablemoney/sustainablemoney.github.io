      <h1>What is this site all about?</h1>
      <p>
        We live in a really complex society where our attention is being pulled from one side of human circumstance to another. We're bombarded with images and stories of people struggling to make ends meet, of people struggling to make ends meet in a financial crisis caused by any number of reasons (job loss, natural disaster, medical bills), but we're also bombarded with advertisements trying to sell us on what our lives would be like if only we bought this doodad, or that insta-worthy experience. All at the same time we're trying to think about our own futures, our own finances, and what matters to us as individuals<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The climate crisis adds another layer of complexity on to our already complicated economic society<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. In order to do our part often we feel like we need to analyze every single thing we do and consume, need to spend more in order to get something more sustainable, and often times the decisions about how sustainable our lives are (to some extent) are made made before they make it to the consumer. It's enough to make people either not care enough to put the effort in, or to be constantly stressed and worried to a point of fatigue and anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        It concerns me that the choice of whether to be environmentally sustainable or not is in the hands of the consumer who also has to consider their own financial limitations, and most often the consumer is someone who is not as likely to be impacted significantly by global climate change<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. It also concerns me that it is in most companies best interest to convince the consumer to buy more than they need, to replace what is still fully functional with something more in vogue, and yet the economic gains from those transactions are mostly not seen by the workers that create products.
      </p>
      <p>
        What my goal is here is to learn not only what can be done to improve our own lives in an environmentally friendly and pocketbook friendly way, but also to explore what the limitations and benefits are of the strategies in place and being proposed. That involves a lot of reading, and hopefully some thoughtful conversations along the way.
      </p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I've got several interests, not least of all are personal finance, environmental sustainability, and socio-economic equality. I'm attracted to the concepts of financial independence (and the FIRE movement) and minimalism, and think in a lot of ways most people's lives could be improved by reducing the level of consumerism that runs rampant in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        I personally buy several things used, don't own a car and am hoping to be able to continue to not need one (full disclosure, my partner does, but I ride in it about once every other week, otherwise I take the bus). We've invested in a backyard compost tumbler, and the average age of all my clothes is about 5 years - some things are more like 15 years old. My big brown CO<sub>2</sub> cloud hanging over my attempt at living an environmentally sustainable lifestyle is air travel. I love to travel and see the world, and my family lives 3000 miles away - my partner's family even farther.
