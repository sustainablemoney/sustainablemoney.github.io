          In case it has escaped anyone's notice, we're going through a very interesting time right now. Over 6 million people in the United States, 25 million people world wide have contracted a virus that has so far killed over 800,000 people<sup><a href="#1" class="footerlink">1</a></sup>. Not only that, but daily we are hitting new record stock market highs, while simultaneously there are 9 million fewer jobs today than there were in February<sup><a href="#2" class="footerlink">2</a> <a href="#3" class="footerlink">3</a></sup>. Small businesses have closed, several permanently, although home foreclosures are at an all time low, a third of US households didn't pay their housing bills (or did not pay them in full) in July<sup><a href="#4" class="footerlink">4</a> <a href="#5" class="footerlink">5</a></sup>. While this is because of several housing protection acts that allowed them to do this and it is an attempt to alleviate the economic crisis going on, it's an indicator of how financially insecure millions of Americans are at the current stage.

          <p id="subtext">This is what my stock portfolio looks like for the last 12 months as of Sept 1st. Despite the fact that millions of people are out of work, the market has completely diverged from the economy. Whether or not a correction is immanent is for the speculators, but the inequality that was discussed in <a href='../the-inner-level-and-inequality'>Income Inequality and The Inner Level</a> seems to only be going up.</p>

          We went through another financial crisis 11 years back, and had many similar complaints about the disparity between the wealthy and everyone else, but this time it's different. It's different because we've all been displaced somehow from our normal lives and eventually have <i>switch back to normal</i>. Because we've all been sidelined, we have the opportunity to make the future something other than the past.
        </p>

          But what does "reopen sustainably" mean?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two facets of it, one is of course <b>making decisions which are environmentally progressive, making updates to our infrastructure which allow us to reduce our impacts on the environment</b>. At risk of disregarding the "revenge travel" that several are planning as soon as they can, including my own travels planned for the future, I think that slowing down and stepping back for a few months can have a real positive impact on how we go forward.
        </p>

        <ul class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
          <li>
            What if, while everyone was out of the office, the companies that were planning on bringing people back in took a look at their HVAC system, so one side of the office wasn't so cold people were running space heaters, while the other side of the office is so warm, people are running fans?<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            Maybe, because we've been figuring out for the last 6 months how to work remotely, we stayed that way<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. This wouldn't necessarily solve any problems: people may take the opportunity to move into suburbs where they are in larger spaces, taking more energy to  control the temperature of their house, and driving farther to get anywhere, or perhaps because they become less dependent on cars in their daily grind.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having spent the last 6 months mostly taking in the environment around you, and learning how to appreciate staying in place, it's natural to as soon as possible get far away from where you've been held up, but also we have the opportunity to maintain the attraction of the area around us reachable by foot, camping and hiking and other outdoors activities that promote an appreciation of the world around us.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
        <p>
          The other facet is in <b>diverting our capital from large corporations to smaller, local businesses</b>. This isn't a new idea, and we could easily have fallen into a trap of being unable to relinquish ourselves of not having to interact with another human and the convenience of buying everything online, however if we decide to change the status quo we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          By supporting small and local businesses, not only are you having a positive impact on your local economy, thereby reducing (however minutely) the diversion of the economy and the market, but often you're supporting more environmentally sustainable practices<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          This might not seem like a particularly enlightening set of ideas. Regardless, as we think abut how we're going to reopen and reshape the economic landscape, we have a more clear cut opportunity to make changes individually and as a society for the better. COVID-19 and the pandemic have been hard for just about everyone, and it's impacted our lives in so many ways. Many people have lost loved ones, or been sick, millions of people have lost their jobs, but at the end of it all, we've still got to live on this earth and as we've all been forced to reexamined our values over the last several months, we have an opportunity to act on staying honest with those value unlike most of us have had before.
