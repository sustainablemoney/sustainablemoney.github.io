      <h4>A shorter introduction to Stephen Smith's </br><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Environmental_Economics_A_Very_Short_Int/4pwuO2B84H4C">Environmental Economics: A Very Short Introduction</a></h4>
      <p class="date">March 17, 2020</p>
      <p>
        I may only be doing the write up for Smith's <u>Environmental Economics: A Very Short Introduction</u> just now, but it was the first thing I read when I began my journey of learning about the economic relationship with climate change several months ago. The book goes through the mechanisms to influence a company to make changes to their systems, the different degrees of environmental impact, as well as discusses the difficulty in determining the degree to which environmental damage abatement is valued by individuals. One thing that I think the book fails to address is the economic impact of lack of environmental damage abatement when there is not a direct cause effect scenario that can be mitigated through a single action (i.e. global climate change).
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>A Very Short Introduction</u> is helpful in beginning the introduction with some basic economic principles and putting them in context with how companies do and are expected to operate given a set of constraints.
      </p>
      <h5>Economic Concepts:</h5>
      <p>
        The main principle defined is comparing marginal abatement costs (MAC)<sup><a href="#1" class="footerlink">1</a></sup> with marginal environmental damages (MED). The expectation is that a business if only inclined to improve their environmental footprint up until the point after which the cost of the environmental data is less that the cost to fix it, or MAC/MED = 1. What this means is that if presumably we can put a dollar amount on how much a degree on environmental wellbeing is worth &ndash; ideally measured in some quantitative way &ndash; we can enforce a system which mandates companies either reach that degree or wellbeing, or pay the difference. Ultimately, if the cost of putting practices in place costs X per unit abatement is greater to the company than the cost of emitting, they will continue to emit that amount of carbon.
      </p>
      <div class="blog-image six columns">
        <img src="../images/MAC_MEC.svg" id="macmed"/>
        <p id="subtext">The more expensive emission abatement costs, the more environmental damage a company is willing to pay for. Of course, in most cases, MAC would be represented on a curve, as easy wins can be cheap, but abating all emissions may require more expensive techniques.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Under the guiding principle that a company is only going to do so much to abate environmental damages as make sense to their bottom line, wee then look into the different strategies which are used to create a cost to the companies for their environmental damage.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Command and Control</b>: Where the government says everyone must limit their pollution to X. This is generally recommended mostly to be used in cases where that "X" amount is 0. Pitfalls of the strategy when there is a non-zero number are that businesses are likely only going to reduce their pollutants to the level defined, for some companies that may be quite cheap and easy, for others much more difficult, leading to potentially economically inefficient ways of reducing emissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Environmental taxes</b>: tax per unit pollution. This incentivizes businesses to reduce their pollutants at least up until the point where the cost per unit abatement is equal to or greater than the tax, but is limited in that it does not guarantee a reduction in pollution, because they could just pay the tax<sup><a href="#2" class="footerlink">2</a> <a href="#3" class="footerlink">3</a></sup>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Emissions trading</b>: a total amount of pollution allowed across all businesses, where permits are allowed to be traded. This allows the market to determine how much pollutants cost. This guarantees a certain level of overall pollution abatement, however can result in wild fluctuations between really high and really low costs<sup><a href="#4" class="footerlink">4</a></sup>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Locality of Environmental Damage:</h5>
      <p>Environmental impact also occurs at several different levels. The more local an issue, the more individual blame &ndash; and therefore cost &ndash; can be put on individual businesses, as well as the more able to have a positive impact a mitigating action can have. Some of these examples are expanded upon from what it articulated in the book.</p>
      <h6>Local:</h6>
      <p>
        Impacts you on the same block, in the same city. The pollutants are also the victims of the pollution and there is a more direct social consequence of not improving on the problem.
      </p>
      <ul class="offset-by-one column">
          <li>
            <b>Ex:</b> London Smog as a result of sulfuric acid being released by the local chimneys impacting health and ability for the city to perform at an efficient economic level<sup><a href="#5" class="footerlink">5</a></sup>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Ex:</b> Waste and water treatment plants directly impacting the housing prices within a half mile or less of the plant<sup><a href="#6" class="footerlink">6</a></sup>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Solutions:</b> Place restrictions (Command and Control) on equipment and pollutants. Moving factories and facilities out of town.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Regional:</h6>
      <p>Multi-city, multi-state and multi-country impacts where the polluters are not all impacted equally relative to their contribution to the problem.</p>
      <ul class="offset-by-one column">
        <li>
          <b>Ex:</b> Acid rain in Europe during the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century unevenly impacted different countries, for instance, the UK was among the heaviest polluters, however much of the resulting acid rain was deposited further east on mainland Europe<sup><a href="#7" class="footerlink">7</a></sup>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ex:</b> Drainage into water systems in the us which impact water quality and quantity in other states. To mitigate this, the Colorado River Compact<sup><a href="#8" class="footerlink">8</a></sup> starting in 1922 and going through now was put into place, which breaks up the water rights of the Colorado River.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Global:</h6>
      <p>
        The impact is global, impact is not evenly distributed either day to day or geographically.
      </p>
      <p>
        The example for this is clearly global climate change. We are still working on figuring out how to resolve the issue and how to get all of the top contributors of carbon emissions to reduce their load. The US and China are the largest per capita contributors to carbon emissions, but were not a member of the Kyoto Protocol which lasted from 1997 to 2012 (US dropped out in 2001)<sup><a href="#9" class="footerlink">9</a></sup>. Now exists the Paris Agreement, however the US has announced it's intention to withdraw<sup><a href="#10" class="footerlink">10</a></sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is the difficulty of incentivizing everyone to take action. Some countries (the US) are huge emitters and have the most work to do but would not necessarily reap the benefits and it would be very costly. A number of countries (Bangladesh) that are most directly and quickly impacted are less able to do anything about it because they are less developed and are already not huge producers of carbon emissions.
      </p>
      <h5>Determining the cost of Marginal Environmental Damage</h5>
      <p>
        This is where I believe the book falls short. It focuses on things like the cost of keeping panda bears alive, and how much people are willing to pay for the aesthetic of a clean hiking trail, or a pristine park rather than the very real economic cost of more environmental health<sup><a href="#11" class="footerlink">11</a></sup>. Regardless, it highlights the difficulty in setting a cost of emissions in economic terms. Stephen's poses the questions <i>how do you measure the economic damage of harm done to future generations? Do we value their lives the same or less than the current state of affairs?</i> How much we value future generations impacts how we chose to solve problems. Acting fast may be economically more inefficient than acting slowly and strategically, but acting slowly may result in compounding effects of climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>A Very Short Introduction</u> is exactly what it tells us it will be: short and introductory. It was a useful read to get in the mindset of how economists and how businesses may see the problems ahead and how they can be incentivized to reduce emissions. I think it also successfully demonstrates the unique challenges when trying to come up with a solution everyone agrees upon where not everyone is impacted to the same degree.
