        <h4>Sustainable Money</h4>
        <p>
          An exploration of what it takes - and whether it is possible - to balance the
          growth of a strong economy with environmental sustainability and social responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through reading of books, academic journals, the news, and other sources I hope to
          have a thoughtful conversation about the following topics (and more):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What is envonmental economics and how can it be used to influence and understand
            the impacts of human consumption?
          </li>
          <li>
            If everyone were to stop hyper consermerism of single use and non-renewable goods,
            what would happen to the economy? Globally? Locally?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can the dogmas of minimalism and financial independence be used together to inform
            a path towards environmental sustainability?
          </li>
          <li>
            What is our social responsibility to consume less or more or in certain ways?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I don't pretend to be an expert on any of these topics, nor do I expect to have an
          unwavering answer to any of these. The goal of this site will be to have a semi-academic,
          semi-reflective conversation about how to earn and spend money sustinablily both at a
          micro and macro economic scale.
        </p>
        <p>Stay tuned for more...</p>
