      <h1>Income Inequality and <u>The Inner Level</u></h1>
      <h2>A look into some of the causes of the rise of income inequality</h2>
      <p class="date">May 1, 2020</p>
      <p>
        To summarize Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate E. Pickett's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40163368-the-inner-level">The Inner Level</a>, income inequality in society tends to exacerbate issues that already exist on a social gradient, while also making it more difficult to traverse different social classes in ones lifetime. The authors make their point citing statistics about mental and physical health in comparison between countries with more or less income inequality, and argues we've spent 95% of human history (calling the beginning of human history 200,000 years ago) in egalitarian hunter gathering societies that we can and should become egalitarian in today's world. Though I fundamentally agree with the general concepts that are being presented, I wished that the authors had paused to think about why inequality is as it is today, and after reading the book it  seems as if income inequality is rather a symptom of other issues rather than the culprit in and of itself, and I wished the authors had acknowledged that. Also, some of the statistics they cite often seem cherry picked, not backed up with statistical rigor (can I get an r<sup>2</sup> over here?), and in a few cases are outright wrong or misleading.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="eight columns offset-by-two"><i>* Side note: The second to last chapter of the book was dedicated to saying that if we're going to create a new economy that is more egalitarian we should consider being better to the planet, but this portion felt like a late add on and didn't seem well researched, so maybe don't go into it thinking you're going to be enlightened on environmental sustainability in any way.</i></p>
      </div>
      <p>
        I don't want to just dismiss the authors' thesis, but I do want to dive a little deeper into the cause of the rise of income inequality since the 1970s, and then use that to look a little closer into their arguments.
      </p>
      <div class="blog-image six columns">
        <img src="../images/productivity_vs_pay.png" alt="Graph representing the divergence of worker productivity vs. compensation."/>
        <p id="subtext">Starting in about 1972 we see a divergence between the average hourly compensation of the bottom 90% of earners and their net productivity.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The chart to the left - or if you're on your phone, above - shows that although workers (the bottom 90% of U.S earners) have dramatically increased in productivity (up 125% from 1972 to 2018), their wages (in consistent 2018 dollars) went up only 23% during that same time period, while the 90th-99th percentile earners had an increase in wages by 59% in that time, and the top 1 percent of earners by 157%. The question becomes why?
      </p>
      <h5>What are a few things that happened in the 1970s?</h5>
      <p>
        Since the divergence began very strikingly in the 1970s, I think in order to understand why we are experiencing such dramatic income inequality today, we need to look into how it all began.
      </p>
      <h6>Invention of the Microprocessor and the Internet</h6>
      <p>
        On November 15th, 1971 Intel&trade; launched the first single-chip microprocessor to the world, the Intel 4004<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, and in 1974, Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn published an article in IEEE magazine establishing TCP protocol<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. With the invention of the microprocessor and then later the Internet, the efficiency at which work could be done - computations made, information communicated accelerated to the point where we are now. As a result of the ever increasing capacity for computers to do the work for us, productivity for any individual worker can increase without an increase in effort.
      </p>
      <h6>War and Globalization</h6>
      <p>
        The trade embargo with China ended in 1971<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>, the US involvment in Vietnam ended in January 1973<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> ending our last major military conflict with any East Asian nation, and finally in May of 1979 a trade agreement was drawn up between the United States and China<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. Because of the reduced conflict in Asia and increased trade for the first time since the invention of the modern shipping container, there was suddenly a huge increase in manufacture competition not previously experienced in the Post-War boom.
      </p>
      <p class="quotation">
        We have reason to believe that Red China has a very large textile industry, and this simply opens up another vast source, for low‐wage imports added to those which already are dis placing hundreds of American jobs. Chinese products are sold, at a political price without regard to cost." &mdash; Howard Richmond, president of Crompton Company, speaking on behalf of American manufacturers, 1971<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>
      </p>
      <h6>Stagflation and Recession</h6>
      <p>
        There are few things that are thought to have caused the "Stagflation"<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup> of the 1970s. One is the "Nixon Shock" which included wage and price freezes and the disassociation of the US dollar from gold. While the measures did manage to reduce inflation temporarily, it enabled an ever increasing trade deficit which we still experience.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>. Another cited instigator of the 1973-75 recession was the oil embargo which lasted from October 1973 to March 1974, quadrupling the cost of oil<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>. During this time there was massive inflation, not just in the US but also in the UK, peaking above 20% in the UK and 13% in the US<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>, driving up interest rates. During this time, I think it's important to note that wages were increasing in dollars during that time, but with inflation<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I have yet to find a source stating this exactly (and I'm not an economist, nor am I formally trained in anything other than <a href="about/">rocks, dead civilizations and writing code</a>), I think it's an important note that during this period of rapid inflation, the economy switching from increasing wages based on production to based on inflation. With the increased competition from globalization of the economy, in order to stay competitive with international workforces and high rates of unemployment, the cost of labor "needed" to stay relatively low to keep it in the US. With increased processor power and automation, the amount of specialization required to be able to do an increasing portion of the available work is diluted thereby it easier to perceive that a low-skill worker's productivity is unrelated to how much income they should earn. The simultaneousness of all three of these factors in the 1970s I think points to how income inequality was able to begin and it becomes unsurprising that after a decade of instability, the nation would chose to elect a president that valued small government and the efficiency of the free market economy (even if that efficient economy involved trickle down economics which by definition leaves more money in the hands of top earners instead of using it to create valuable services for all).
      </p>
      <h5>Okay, but The Inner Level isn't about the 1970s</h5>
      <p>
        The Inner Level tells us that the following things increase with income inequality across all social classes but most significantly amongst the lower income classes (with the exemption of the environmental ones, but also I'm not convinced we consume more meat and gasoline <i>because</i> we live in an unequal economic environment):
      </p>
      <ul class="offset-by-one column five columns">
        <li>Life expectancy</li>
        <li>Infant mortality</li>

        <li>Mental Illness</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Status Anxiety</li>
        <li>Narcissism</li>
        <li>Substance Abuse</li>
        <li>Social Capital</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="six columns">
        <li>Solidarity</li>
        <li>Civic and Cultural Participation</li>
        <li>Imprisonment</li>
        <li>Bullying</li>
        <li>Social immobility</li>
        <li>Educational attainment<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></li>
        <li>Water, meat, and petrol consumption</li>
        <li>Status Consumption</li>
        <li>Compliance with international environmental agreements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although it may be true that all of these things increase with income inequality - though some statements are flat out wrong<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> - understanding how we got to where we are today becomes vitally important in being able to take ownership over resolving the problems. In the last chapter, the authors suggest a few policy changes, and try to emphasize that there existed policies (mostly calling out those enacted by Reagan) which decreased the power of unions and increased the power of corporations while also decreasing the support provided by the US government. This would be more strongly felt if discussion of policy (especially those which have caused or reduced income inequality) occurred more throughout the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="03102020-functional-inefficiency/">Functional Inefficiency</a>, Peter Wenz describes the mentality around consumerism in France (GINI Index of 31.6 as of 2017) as being much less status oriented, and more focused on having enough than in the US (GINI Index of 41.4 as of 2016 &mdash; remember higher means more inequality). People are less willing to sell their time in order to afford items they don't view as being necessary. The <a href="dogmas-of-financial-indepence/">FIRE movement</a> suggests a mindset which rejects consuming status symbols, and detaching oneself as early as possible from having to sell ones time for money. Although my feelings on The Inner Level discussed above are that it's too focused on encapsulating all of the problems with 1st world nations under the umbrella of income inequality it does identify several key issues that arise simultaneously with income inequality, and from that we can determine how to move forward.

        <li id="12"><sup>12</sup> In chapter 6 we read:
          <p class="quotation">
            "It might seem sensible to assume that spending more money on education would help overcome the disadvantages of poverty, deprivation and inequality. To test this, researchers examined national income, income inequity and government spending on education in relation to educational achievement along adolescents. ... they found that higher Gross Domestic Product per person has only a small beneficial effect on educational achievement. In contrast income inequality turned out to have a large and damaging effect on literacy among these adolescence. Neither economic growth not the allocation of proceeds of growth to public education appear to be panaceas for poor educational outcomes."
          </p>
          <p>
            This is all good and well, however it in the next paragraph goes on to contradict the previous statement.
          </p>
          <p class="quotation">
            "A case study that exemplifies how countries can transform and improve education and children's life chances is offered by Finland. ... Finland made a wholesale reform to its educational system about 40 years ago and move to an entirely comprehensive school system. It improved the quality of teacher training and raised the status of the teach professions: all teachers now have a Master's degree and a great deal of autonomy in what and how they teach within the framework of the national curriculum."
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, Finland increased the amount of money the government was spending on teachers - increasing pay and increasing training. One of the biggest problem's I've had with this book is that it is heavily biased in trying to make it's point about income inequality that it neglects to acknowledge other more tangible factors that can and do have an impact.
          </p></li>
          <li id="13"><sup>13</sup> The statements made about the increase of obesity amongst individual US states related to their income inequality either misleading or wrong. I can't find the quote, but at one point the authors state that obesity is more of a problem in states with greater income inequality, however based on the data I gathered from statista about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/227249/greatest-gap-between-rich-and-poor-by-us-state/">the GINI index of each states</a> and from the CDC about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/prevalence-maps.html">the prevalence of obesity by state</a>, the correlation between the two data sets results in r<sup>2</sup>=0.0006. On a hunch I randomly grabbed data about the <a href="https://www.governing.com/gov-data/education-data/state-education-spending-per-pupil-data.html">per capita spending on education by state</a> from Governing.com, and found upon comparing it to the rate of obesity the correlation to be r<sup>2</sup>=0.2036. (still not high, but not essentially zero)</li>
